# Fileshare Client

The modern client for [Fileshare](https://github.com/Reinachan/filesharing).

## Goals

This is supposed to partially replace the basic frontend rendered by the filesharing backend. The purpose of the original frontend was to be as simple as possible and working without JS. This new frontend does not intend to be as compatible as possible and instead is allowed to rely on modern browser features that are baseline or that are only progressively enhanced in specific browsers.

- Simple UI that is easy to use for anyone who've never used it before
- Good accessibility
- Modern CSS
- Simple to deploy alongside the server
